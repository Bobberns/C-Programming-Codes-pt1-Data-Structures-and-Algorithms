Pre-Final Topics
1) ADT Tree and implementations  [Source: Data Structure by Aho, Hopcroft, and Ullman]
   * Definition of a tree 
   * Basic concepts and terms related to tree
   * Tree Traversals [Preorder, Inorder, Postorder]
   * ADT Tree Implementations
     a. Parent Pointer Implementation
     b. List of Children Implementation
   * Binary Tree definition and Implementations 
   * Expression Trees
   * Huffman Code
2) Binary Search Tree (BST)   [Sources: There are many sites in the internet such as Geeks for Geeks]
   * Description and Implementation
   * Operations: Insert, Delete, and Member
   * Similarity and Difference between BST and AVL trees
   * Binary Search vs. Sequential Search
3) ADT Priority Queue   
   * Partially Ordered Tree (POT)
   * Min and Max heap
      - MinHeap ==> Operations: insert and deleteMin  [Source: Data Structure by Aho, Hopcroft, and Ullman]
      - MaxHeap ==> Operations: insert and deleteMax  [Sources: Internet]
    * MinHeapify and MaxHeapify
      Version 1: Insert all elements in an initially empty POT  [Source: ebook]
      Version 2: Heapify starting with lowest level parent      [Sources: Internet]
4) Heapsort Sorting Technique (in place)
    * A sorting algorithm is an "in place" sorting algorithm if there is no additional array is used when implementing the sorting process.
