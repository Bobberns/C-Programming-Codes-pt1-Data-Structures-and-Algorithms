Practice Exercises for Linked Lists

1. Basic Operations
    insert front / rear / at / sorted
    delete front / rear / at
    search an element
2. Traversal
    print all elements
    reverse the linked list
3. Merging and Splitting
    create two linked lists and merge into a single sorted linked lists
    given a linked list, create a function to split it into two halves
4. Detecting and Handling Loops
    implement function to detect if linked list has a loop
    write a function to remove a loop in a linked list if one is detected 
5. Sorting 
    merge sort
    insertion sort
6. Counting and Removing Duplicates
    write a function to count the number of occurences of a specific value in a linked list
    implement a function to remove duplicate elements fromm an unsorted linked list
7. Circular Linked List
    implement and perform basic Operations
8. Memory Management
    pay attention to memory allocation and deallocation in your linked list operations to avoid memory leaks
