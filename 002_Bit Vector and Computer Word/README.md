Learning Bit Vector and Computer Word

What is Computer Word? 
    This is simply representing your variable as how the computer reads it; binary representation of your variables. 
    ex. 'A' = 01000001

What is Bit Vector?
    Bit Vector is the array representation of a set (per single element) where it's values are marked as "1" on its respective index. 
    ex. set A = {2, 1, 4, 7} = [1] [0] [0] [1] [0] [1] [1] [0]

How to represent the following:
    Single Data (single variables)
    Collection of Data (arrays, linked list, cursor based)

Conversion Types:
    "unsigned int" - scanf("%u") and printf("%u") // "unsigned char" - scanf("%hhu") and printf("%c")
