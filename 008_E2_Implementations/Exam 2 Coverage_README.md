Topics for the Midterm
1) Set and ADT Set
   a. ADT Set vs. ADT List 
     - What are the differences between the two?
   b. ADT's based on Set
      1) ADT UID 
         * an ADT based on set with operations Union, Intersection, and set Difference
         * Implementations
           i. Array, Linked list, and cursor-based implementations
          ii. Bit-Vector Implementation
         iii. Computer Word Implementation
              - Shift operators:  >>  and <<
              - Bit-wise operators:  &  ^  |  ~
       2) ADT Dictionary
          * An ADT based on set with Operations: Insert, Delete, and Member
          * Two types of Hashing:
            a. Open Hashing (or External Hashing)
            b. Closed Hashing (or Internal Hashing) 

         * Closed Hashing Terms: Collision, Synonyms, Linear Hashing or Probing, Displacement, Packing Density (Load Factor), Average Search Length, Perfect Hash Function
         * Closed Hashing variations
         * Closed Hashing in external Memory (Files: fopen, fclose, fread, fwrite, fseek)
