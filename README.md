Hello, and welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms journey.

In this repository you will find all of my codes compiled althroughout my love for DSA. Do take note that the folders contain the following:
- 000 to 006 - are all from my first take
- 007 to 010 - are from my second take

For extra notes and visualizations, I have my MIRO board where I compile all of my notes and try to expound concepts there. I hope these are helpful to you as it is to me.
